# Roscoe-Memorial

This was a porfolio project for a Web Development Class, as well as being a true memorial.  It is a static website, and lacks functionality on the 'guest book' page (guest comments entered on the form do not persist). Also, the gallery page doesn't look as clean as it should.  But my intention was to code the website entirely by hand, with no Bootstrap or other framework.  It turned out nicely, and I am please that it is mostly responsive (the gallery page being a little un-responsive). I did borrow some W3 code for the carousel.
