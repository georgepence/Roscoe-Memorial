# Roscoe-Memorial

This was a porfolio project for a Web Development Class.  It is a static website, and lacks functionality on the 'guest book' page (guest comments entered on the form do not persist). 

My intention with this website was to code it entirely by hand, with no Bootstrap or other framework.  I did borrow some W3 code for the carousel.
