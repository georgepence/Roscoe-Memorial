    Roscoe's Story
  </header>
  <p>In June 2014, a tri-color hound arrived at the SPCA in Richmond, Virginia. No one knew his name or history, but
    speculation was that he had been a hunting dog lacking ability or temperament for that task, and thus ran away or
    was abandoned. SPCA employees estimated his age at 7 years, and named him “Wescott”. While perhaps not a gifted
    hunting dog, it turned out that Wescott’s had a talent was making friends. Wescott was at the welcome desk when a
    couple came to look for a small lap dog as a companion to their 13 pound terrier. In short order they took the 50
    pound Wescott home, renaming him Roscoe.</p>
  <p>With large expressive brown eyes and head at perfect petting height, Roscoe befriended everyone he met. As he and
    Chico took their daily neighborhood walks, Roscoe made a point of greeting every person. Roscoe and Chico were both
    also friends with the neighborhood dogs, always well behaved and calm with everyone. Roscoe loved the outdoors, and
    never turned down a chance to go for a walk.</p>
  <p>Roscoe and Chico divided up duties in their pack. Chico ran the house, while Roscoe made sure the owners fed them
    on time and walked them often. At dinnertime, Roscoe found the human servers and performed an intricate “dinner
    dance” to let them know it was time to put some food down. Roscoe never failed to perform this reminder, and thus he
    and Chico never missed a meal.</p>
  <p>One of Roscoe’s main joys was riding in the car to their vacation home in Lexington, Virginia. The car was like a
    magic box. He and Chico would hop in the back seat, go to sleep, and when they woke up they found themselves in a
    completely new place. Roscoe would even walk up to the back door of completely strange cars, just on the off chance
    someone might let him hop in. </p>
  <p>Roscoe also loved to find the smallest corner possible, curl up, and go to sleep. He particularly loved his crate,
    which was dubbed “Roscoe’s Cave”. Roscoe especially sought out safe places during thunderstorms, as he was afraid of
    loud noises. He would sense impending storms well before they arrived and go hide, often being found in a closet,
    the bathroom shower, or behind the sofa.</p>
